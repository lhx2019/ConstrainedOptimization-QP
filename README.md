# ConstrainedOptimization-QP
Constrained optimization algorithms (log barrier and interior point methods) for a Quadratic Program.
This is my last homework for optimization course under supervision of [Dr. Maryam Amirmazlaghani at AUT](https://ceit.aut.ac.ir/autcms/people/verticalPagesAjax/professorHomePage.htm?url=mazlaghani&depurl=computer-engineering&lang=en&cid=11875).

I implemented log barrier and interior point methods for solving a quadratic program problem with an equality constraint. 
The implementations of these algorithms are available in [`algorithms.py`](https://github.com/mohamad-amin/ConstrainedOptimization-QP/blob/master/algorithms.py) and the sample usage and diagrams are available in [`example_usage.ipynb`](https://github.com/mohamad-amin/ConstrainedOptimization-QP/blob/master/example_usage.ipynb).

More info about the algorithms and QPs are found here:
